# Visit (Interactive Concept Demo)

Visit (aka line-breaker) app is a booth reserving system for convention attendees. The app allows users to input their estimated time of stay and their desired booths or stalls to visit. It then asks users to prioritize these booths by grouping them into groups that are differentiated by level of interest. With the user preference information collected, our app will create an itinerary for every user that is the optimal solution minimizing the overall wait time of all the visitors. A user is assigned a particular time slot during their period of stay to visit each booth, and during the reserved time slots, they enjoy VIP admissions to those booths.
